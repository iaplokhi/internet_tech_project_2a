    <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
    <p>Derived from the white nights of Russia’s Northern Capital, Saint Petersburg, and the vast mountains of North Carolina, Charm is an independent alternative rock duet that synergizes Ivan Plokhikh’s bright guitar riffs with Emma Jackson’s experimental synth and poetic lyrics. The two musicians met in a songwriting class during their music studies at  New Orleans’s Loyola University and quickly developed an interest in each other’s talents.  They started their journey as collaborators with the goal of blending their styles in order to create an honest and charming album. As of today, their music aims to convey the raw and turbulent nature of the human experience. </p>
